# Getting Started

Create a new folder, initialize a new npm project and download node dependencies

<SyntaxHighlighter language="shell" style={funky}>
  {`
    mkdir -p your-new-project/src/main && cd your-new-project
    npm init # follow the intructions
    npm i body-parser cookie-parser cors create-react-class csurf --save
    npm i express helmet js-joda moment morgan npm-run-all react react-dom --save
    npm i serve-static source-map-support xhr2 --save
    npm i nodemon shadow-cljs --save-dev
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

Ensure that you have the following files and folders

<SyntaxHighlighter language="shell" style={funky}>
  {`
    .
    ├── app.js
    ├── config.edn

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained**. Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable**. You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

## Consistency

Your first, most important task when starting out is to define the rules of your system, document them, and ensure that everyone follows them. When you have clearly documented code standards and best practices in place, designers and developers from across your organization can easily use and, more importantly, contribute to your design system.
